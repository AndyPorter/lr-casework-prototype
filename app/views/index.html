	<!-- feel free to change this page to suit your needs -->

	<p class="lede">What might a User interface for staff look like.  How these digital mortgages could be/are going to be registered.  What 'digital' work looks like.</p><p>Based upon -
	<ul>
		<li>what we've learnt about mortgage processing/casework from staff and stakeholders</li>
		<li>what we've learnt about (and from) our people (staff)</li>
		<li>what other government departments are doing - how they administer and internally process  services</li>
		<li>what does digital world / work look like (like services you would <b>choose</b> to use at home)</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<h2 class="heading-large">Design Principles</h2>
	<p class="lede"><a rel="external" href="http://design-manual.herokuapp.com/index-internal">General design principles</a> live in the <a rel="external" href="http://design-manual.herokuapp.com/">design manual</a>.  Specific principles and guidance not yet general enough are listed here.</p>


	<h2 class="heading-large">User interfaces - phase 2<span  class="heading-secondary">Now... (from November 2015)</span></h2>
	<p>Digital mortgages to be routed and some/all processing automated.  Either routed to exisiting estate (e.g. CORA), or routed to 'new world'.  New world to be designed to process as much as possible automatically.  Some steps might be easier/preferable to get a user to do...</p>
	<p>morgtage application -> has priority? -> drafted register -> check register change.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>has priority - needs human check?  if human - check in a) exisitng systems, b) new ui</li>
		<li>check register change - needs human check?  if human - a) check whole register?, b) a part of the register?  [i.e. how much is auto checked and how much needs human]</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 class="heading-medium">The Service</h3>
	<p>Digital Mortgage is the service, most/all to be automated.  How do we monitor and administer the internal elements of the service.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>some sort of performance / admin ui</li>
		<li>ability to look at 'cases' / applications</li>
		<li>task -> ability to see the mortgage application has priority - application ahead in the queue is a the paceholder for this mortgage (towel on the deckchair) (OS(W) - search)</li>
		<li>task -> approve/fail a draft register / section of a register / other name for a part of the whole.  Or many different small tasks - e.g. check restriction, check name discrepancy, mismatch address, etc - TBD</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 class="heading-large">User interfaces - phase 1 - 'alpha'<span  class="heading-secondary">March 2015 to October 2015</span></h2>
	<h3 class="heading-medium">Sept / October 2015</h3>
	<p>Digital mortgages to be routed and processed automatically.  Either routed to exisiting estate (e.g. CORA), or routed to 'new world'.  New world to be designed to process automatically.  But, for confidence, design a user interface to allow 'the business' be confident enough in the automatic processes.</p>
	<p>Current thinking, is to present 'caseworkers' with the drafted copies of the whole register, to review/flag as incorrect</p>
	<h4 class="heading-small">Untested designs, thinking in code/what it could look and feel like...</h4>
	<p>list based ideas, slight changes in the list, variety of registers - how to check the draft, ways to progress through the 'bunch' of registers, trying different language.  The constant is the register (although trying slight variations in presentation)</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="/quality-check-v3/list-idea-3a"><b>latest</b></a></li>
		<li><a href="/quality-check-v3/list-idea-3a-alt">latest - alternate version</a></li>
		<li><a href="/quality-check-v2/list-idea-3a">previous - traditional web layout</a></li>
		<li><a href="/quality-check-v2/list-idea-3a-alt">previous - register first</a></li>
		<li><a href="/quality-check-v1/list-idea-1">prior - plus check for prior applications (daylist)</a>, progress feedback</li>
		<li><a href="/quality-check-v1/list-idea-2">prior: variant 2</a></li>
		<li><a href="/quality-check-v1/list-idea-3">prior: variant 3</a></li>
		<li><a href="/quality-check-v1/list-idea-3a">prior: variant 3 - also has the errors found (for same user to process in CORA)</a></li>
		<li><a href="/quality-check-v1/list-idea-3a-alt">prior: variant 3a also has the errors found (for same user to process in CORA)</a></li>

	</ul>

	<h3 class="heading-medium">July to Sept 2015</h3>
	<p>lists, 'case' pages, and registers.  different look and feels, differing flows and presentation of information.  How might things work if documents are supplied alongside the application.  Is the simple morgtage review flow/pattern suitable for more complex application.</p>
